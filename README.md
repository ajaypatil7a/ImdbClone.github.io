I have created this app using tmdb api From that API can fetch movies. First, trending movies are shown and liked movies will be shown you can search any movie you want. Search results will appear. In those search results, you can click on movie card which will show the movie details to you.

You can add movie by clicking on favorite icon shown on the movie page also remove the movies from favorite by clicking on the favorite icon shown below the movie poster.
